How to access: This web app is located at https://ccatherinee.github.io/CS279R/HW0/. 

How to use: 
- to add tasks to the todo list, type the task into the black rectangular box which says "E.g. CS 279R Programming Assignment 0" in light-grey lettering and hit enter
- to "cross-out" tasks that have been finished, click on the task name or somewhere near it
- to delete a task from the todo list completely, click the big red button next to the corresponding task 
- to order the tasks by priority, click on the task and drag it to where you want it to go (beyond-basic functionality drag and drop)
